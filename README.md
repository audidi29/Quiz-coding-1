# Quiz-coding-1

This was my first javascript coding and I can say that the struggle was real. The goal this week was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. Apart from the fact that it was challenging for me, I was able to see through this quiz (and thanks to our first project) that I acquired new knowledge, but that I also have things that I still have to work on. I will continue to work on this project and improve the functionality and the interface over the time.
